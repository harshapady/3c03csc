      <h1>Boyband</h1>
      <p>A boy band is loosely defined as a vocal group consisting of young male singers, usually in their teenage years or in their twenties at the time of formation,[1] singing love songs marketed towards girls. Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances.

Some such bands form on their own, often evolving out of church choral or gospel music groups. In contrast, many are created by talent managers or record producers who hold auditions. Due to this and their general commercial orientation towards a female audience of preteens, teenyboppers, or teens, the term can be pejorative in music journalism. Boy bands are similar in concept to their counterparts, girl groups. Boy bands' popularity peaked four times: in the 1960s (e.g., the Jackson 5 and the Osmonds), in the 1990s and early 2000s when acts such as the Take That, Backstreet Boys,NSYNC, Boyzone, F4, D2B and Westlife, among others, dominated global pop charts like the American Billboard, in the early 2010s with the emergence of popular new boy bands such as Big Time Rush, One Direction, and The Wanted, and in the late 2010s and early 2020s with K-pop acts like BTS, Exo, Seventeen and NCT, and pop groups such as CNCO, Why Don't We and PrettyMuch.</p>
